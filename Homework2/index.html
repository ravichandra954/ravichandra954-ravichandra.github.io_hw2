        <h1 style="font-size: 35px;">Welcome to My Website!</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 28px;">I am  Ravi Chandra, and I love coding and learning new things.As an accomplished coder and a skilled cricket player. My coding journey began with a natural curiosity for technology, leading me to master various programming languages and solve complex problems with elegant solutions. This expertise not only fuels my professional success but also reflects my passion for innovation and continuous learning.

            On the cricket field, I exhibit strategic thinking, agility, and teamwork, contributing significantly to my team's victories. Beyond the boundaries of the field and code, I am an avid advocate for mental health awareness, actively supporting initiatives that promote well-being in the tech and sports communities.
            
            My multifaceted interests and dedication to excellence make me a dynamic and engaging individual, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to make a positive impact in diverse spheres of life.</p>
